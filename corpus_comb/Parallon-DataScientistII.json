{"job title": "Data Scientist II", "company": "Parallon", "city state": "\u2013 Nashville, Tennessee", "rating": "2.7", "job description": "<strong><br><br>Description</strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong> About HCA</strong>\n<br><br>\nNashville-based HCA is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating 171 locally managed hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44 percent. HCA is a learning healthcare system that uses its more than 27 million annual patient encounters to advance science, improve patient care and save lives.\n<br><br>\nData Science is a new function within CDM focusing on utilizing our data resources to improve the clinical and operating performance of HCA. This team is focused on identifying such opportunities and working with the wider organization to operationalize them. Data Scientist II is the level position in this specialty intended for an individual of 3+ years experience.\n<br><br>\nThe role of the data scientist is to use mathematics, programming and visualization to discover, in partnership with the business, opportunities and insights arising from HCA data systems. This role is firmly customer facing, with an expectation of constant contact, communication and iteration with both clinical and business customers to define questions, explore solutions and present results. As such the data scientist must be comfortable and capable of clearly communicating the nature and results of complex analytics to non-technical users in written, spoken and visual means.\n<br><br>\nOn the technical front the data scientist must be comfortable with 'data wrangling'. That is, the ability to identify, and extract raw data from primary transactions systems such as databases. Thereafter they must possess basic skills in programming to manage, transform and integrate with other datasets, in preparation for analytics. Typically this is performed in scripting languages such as Python.\n<br><br>\nThe analytic skills required are based principally in machine learning and statistics. The data scientist must have a working knowledge of regression and classification techniques such as logistic regression, boosting, SVM and neural networks. Moreover, the data scientist must understand the scientific process of hypothesis generation and testing, in particular data oriented discovery methodologies such as cross validation. Typically, these functions are performed in a mathematical environment such as R, MATLAB or SAS, proficiency with which is assumed.\n<br><br>\n<strong> Duties and Responsibilities</strong>\n<li> Ensure a standardized and consistent approach relating to CDM participation and implementation in all phases of the data science life cycle.</li>  <li> Partners with colleagues and customers to achieve meaningful discussions regarding data outputs and feedback on usage activities to improve CDM output.</li>  <li> Can extract data from primary sources reliably.
