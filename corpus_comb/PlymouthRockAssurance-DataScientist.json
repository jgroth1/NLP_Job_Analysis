In this role, you will be set on a constant \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d for new data sources to apply the latest techniques for modeling to. You will have unparalleled opportunity to apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to real world datasets. You will work with highly intelligent and accomplished individuals who understand and value technical challenges. You will work on a team of PhD level statisticians to create ground-breaking predictive models using new analytical techniques that determine insurance pure premiums, customer life time value, customer buying behaviors and other related topics. This work will be used in setting pricing, underwriting, marketing, policy and claims service, fraud detection and product design strategies for the Plymouth Rock group of Companies. The role is not simply research: you will be part of a tactical team driving the profit and customer growth of an assigned business segment.
