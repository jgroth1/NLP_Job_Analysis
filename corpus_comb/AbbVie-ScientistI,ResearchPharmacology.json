{"job title": "Scientist I, Research Pharmacology", "company": "AbbVie", "city state": "\u2013 South San Francisco, CA", "rating": "3.7", "job description": "Oncology is a key therapeutic area for AbbVie, with a portfolio\n<br>\n consisting of three marketed products Imbruvica, Venclexta, and Empliciti \n<br>\n and a pipeline containing multiple promising new molecules that are being\n<br>\n studied in nearly 200 clinical trials in 19 different types of cancer.\n<br><br>\nAbbVie is expanding its oncology hub on the West Coast, with three\n<br>\n sites in the San Francisco Bay Area (Redwood City, South San Francisco, and\n<br>\n Sunnyvale) focused on the discovery and development of novel oncology\n<br>\n therapies. More than 1,000 AbbVie scientists, clinicians, and product\n<br>\n developers with strong entrepreneurial roots work across these three sites.\n<br>\n They combine their expertise in immuno-oncology, stem cells, and cell-signaling\n<br>\n with their knowledge of bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs),\n<br>\n and covalent-inhibitor technologies to discover and develop novel cancer\n<br>\n treatments. This position will be based at Stemcentrx, AbbVie's South San\n<br>\n Francisco, CA location.\n<br><br>\nThe Research Pharmacology Department is searching for a Scientist I who will\n<br>\n participate in evaluating novel anti-cancer therapies for pharmacokinetics (PK),\n<br>\n and biomarker analyses in vivo. The candidate will measure drug\n<br>\n concentrations and/or biomarkers to be used for PK study analyses; optimize\n<br>\n ligand binding assay protocols as needed; perform non-compartmental\n<br>\n pharmacokinetics analyses and interpret data; and, communicate data via\n<br>\n presentations and reports. The candidate will spend a mixture of their time in\n<br>\n the lab environment and performing computer work and analysis. Opportunities for additional projects related\n<br>\n to pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics could be granted based on\n<br>\n candidates interests.
