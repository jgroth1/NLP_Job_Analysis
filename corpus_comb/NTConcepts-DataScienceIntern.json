{"job title": "Data Science Intern", "company": "NT Concepts", "city state": "\u2013 Vienna, Virginia", "rating": "3.8", "job description": "NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. Its our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (youve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since lifes too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.\n<br><br>\nOne of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team.
