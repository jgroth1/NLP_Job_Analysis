{"job title": "Data Science Summer 2019 Intern", "company": "Next Tier Concepts, Inc.", "city state": "\u2013 , US", "rating": "3.8", "job description": "NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It\u2019s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you\u2019ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life\u2019s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.\n<br><br>\nOne of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You\u2019ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, work on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise.
