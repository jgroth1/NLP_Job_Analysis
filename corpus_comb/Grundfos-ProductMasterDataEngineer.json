Thus, you have the role as data engineer and global data maintainer, working together with other data colleagues to design changes and resolve process or data issues. This involves guiding projects or business areas in the structure, use and analysis of data to make sure each structure is optimized for Grundfos and our customers.\n<br><br>\nYou will be responsible for coordinating local and regional data requirements in a global perspective. This also entails aligning interactions, following up on data quality reports, assisting in formulating and prioritizing new initiatives to improve data processes and acting as change manager when new initiatives are implemented.\n<br><br>\n<u><strong><em>What do you need to apply?</em></strong></u>\n<br><br>\n- You have obtained great technical skills through your education as a Technical Designer, Data Base Manager or Engineer.\n<br><br>\n- You have 4+ years of experience from a development department in a global organization where you have been able to roll out data findings and drive change\n<br><br>\n- You work well in an online environment while supporting agile practices and activities.\n<br><br>\n- You have experience with classification of product data and an advantage if you know SAP\n<br><br>\n- You have an understanding of product implementation and change management processes\n<br><br>\n\u201cYou are a self-starter with excellent communication and organizational skills, and you master handling several tasks and multiple priorities as we have many tasks at hand across the organization. Being detail-oriented is also very important, and you have to be persistent to find solutions in a complex setup - and convince your colleagues of possible changes.\n<br><br>\nThis will also entail carrying out support, so you have to be good at maintaining customer relationships.
