We are building tools that combine state-of-the-art machine learning with econometrics to bring automation to economic decision making. The heart of this project is striving to measure causation: if you want to understand or make policy decisions in a complex economy, you need to know why the system moves the way it does.\n<br><br>\nMicrosoft Research has a long tradition of work at the intersection of Economics and Computer Science, and this team brings together researchers from across Social Science, Computer Science, and Machine Learning. The Alice project allows us to dramatically scale the success that we?ve had in adapting existing ML technology for economic applications and in developing new deep learning architectures for causal inference. All of our research is tied to concrete policy-relevant applications, including work on demand estimation and price optimization, on measuring effectiveness of advertising and sales strategies. The goal is to use AI to improve and democratize economic research while taking from economic theory to push the frontier of AI.\n<br><br>\nWe are looking for a Data Scientist with strong analytical and developer skills to join our diverse team in developing industry leading machine learning solutions. Successful candidates will have several years of experience analyzing data and developing models across a breadth of technology platforms. Furthermore, since the group of us that make up Alice are hyper-focused on solving _real world_ economic challenges with AI, a great person for this position will share with us the desire to solve problems for partners whether by leveraging sophisticated custom machine learning models or straightforward data analysis.\n<br><br>\nWe look forward to connecting with you!\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Responsibilities**</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Role and Responsibilities:</strong>\n<br><br>\n+ You'll be a member of a cross-disciplinary team of engineers, data scientists and researchers.\n<br><br>\n+ Applying data analysis learnings to a general purpose open source toolkit used for applying AI techniques to economic problems.\n<br><br>\n+ Learning new skills rapidly and applying as needed, e.g., learn a new machine learning algorithm from a research paper and implementing it\n<br><br>\n+ Providing high quality support to all researchers in the lab.\n<br><br>\n+ Creating and maintaining relationships with product teams.\n<br><br>\n+ Ability to effectively work in collaborative multiple project team environment and ship production features in a fast-paced startup environment.\n<br><br>\n+ Develop and deploy solutions with Microsoft Partners for solving business problems using machine learning and predictive modeling techniques.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Qualifications**</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Qualifications:</strong>\n<br><br>\n+ Bachelor?s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, or related field (or the equivalent experience).\n<br><br>\n+ 3+ years of experience in applying, implementing, and/or developing algorithms for machine learning, artificial intelligence, or statistics.
