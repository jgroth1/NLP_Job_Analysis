The combination of a new multidimensional gene correction platform and a management team that has successfully developed and commercialized rare disease therapies positions the Company to move beyond the current limitations of gene therapy and gene editing approaches to improve patient care. Homology Medicines has built foundational intellectual property on gene editing and gene therapy using vectors derived from naturally occurring human adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). The Company's technology is precise, on-target and highly efficient for <em>in vivo</em> editing of genetic mutations. The team and technology create a significant opportunity for Homology Medicines to rapidly advance a diverse pipeline of new medicines that address and potentially cure the underlying cause of genetic diseases.</p>\n<p> </p>"}
