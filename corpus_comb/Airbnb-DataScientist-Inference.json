{"job title": "Data Scientist - Inference", "company": "Airbnb", "city state": "\u2013 San Francisco, California", "rating": "4.0", "job description": "<em>Note: Due to volume of applications we receive, we kindly ask that you only apply to a maximum of one Data Scientist role from among those posted. This does not preclude you from being considered for multiple roles. Thank you.</em>\n<br><br>\nAirbnb has become a global platform that connects travelers and hosts from over 34,000 cities. As such, experimentation is core to our growing business. We want to take a scientific approach to decision-making through careful hypothesis generation and testing and drive actions/refine strategies through insights from experimental analysis.\n<br><br>\nOur inference data scientists are deep in understanding the complications of running experiments in a two-sided marketplace, power analysis and stopping criterions, and statistical models to improve power/significance. Another interesting problem space is understanding what to do when we are unable to conduct experiments. How do we understand the impact of something new?\n<br><br>\nWe are looking for experienced Data Scientists to join our team and expand upon the work we have done. Here are some examples of projects we currently need help with:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Develop experiments to reduce friction in the listing creation process for hosts</li>\n<li>Designing experiments to measure the lift when displaying hotel rooms on our platform</li>\n<li>Create product experiments (on service fees, early demand, etc) and measure the impact on market dynamics (such as competitors).</li>\n<li>Improve the statistical methodology behind our experimentation platform to ensure that our understanding of product changes is rigorous and accurate</li>\n</ul>\nTo learn more, read about our Inference data science work:\n\n<ul>\n<li>4 Principles for Making Experimentation Count</li> \n\n<li>Scaling Airbnb's Experimentation Platform</li>\n</ul>\nWe have a strong team of Data Scientists, our work is highly sought-after, and our impact on the business is tremendous. If you have a proven background in this field and are excited to help build Airbnb\u2019s community, we want to hear from you.\n<br><br>\nSome examples of traits we value:\n\n<ul>\n<li>A passion for Airbnb\u2019s mission of helping people Belong Anywhere</li>\n<li>Ability to write clean and concise code, especially in R or Python</li>\n<li>3+ years in industry experience and a Master's degree in a quantitative field or Economics; PhD is a plus</li>\n<li>Solid understanding of statistics</li>\n<li>Keen eye for detail and thoughtful investigation of data before relying upon it</li>\n<li>Intuition for data science best practices, stemming from proven experience</li>\n<li>Steadfast focus on creating impactful change</li>\n<li>Ability to partner with cross-functional teams using strong written and verbal communication</li> \n</ul>"}
