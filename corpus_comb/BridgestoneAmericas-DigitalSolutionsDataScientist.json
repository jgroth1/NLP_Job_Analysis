Join us in a collaborative and hands-on team environment that fosters engineering excellence, creativity, and innovation with a focus on automotive and tire performance prediction.\n<br><br>\nThis teammate will perform and lead medium scale advanced statistical analysis with moderate supervision. This data scientist performs the analyses while also teaching less experienced data scientists and engineers in those and other techniques as applicable. This role will also require effective communication on multiple levels, using highly technical language with other engineers/scientists and translating technical results clearly and effectively for Manager-Level and below teammates. Despite this being a technical role, this teammate\u2019s business skills are high enough to develop professional relationships with managers outside of the group that instill trust in the methodologies. Performs primarily medium scale statistical analyses or medium scale modeling projects independently."}
