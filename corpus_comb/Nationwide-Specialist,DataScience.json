Qualified candidates will possess an extensive knowledge of statistics and/or a proven track record of its use in real-world problem-solving. A familiarity with the principles of machine learning, applied predictive modeling, Bayesian modeling, and time series forecasting methods is preferred, and an advanced degree in Statistics or a related field is required and/or relevant experience. Subject matter expertise in areas like customer growth and retention and marketing analytics/optimization are desired.\n<br><br>\nThe candidate must be willing to work with business professionals who are not statisticians, and thus the ability to communicate highly technical material in a friendly, non-threatening manner is essential. The candidate must demonstrate a desire to create business value over all else even when the competitor is statistical elegance. Conversely, the candidate must show continual improvement of theoretical and applied skills with evidence of a desire to continue technical learning and growth both as a statistician and a business professional.\n<br><br>\nRoutine tasks for this position include building models and forecasts within Nationwide's \"Model Factory\" environment, an enterprise-class model building and deployment framework that allows rapid deployment of predictive models directly into business operations. This person will help to improve the Model Factory and its associated processes including, but not limited to, evaluation of the models in the field, refitting/retraining of existing models, and assisting with ongoing team peer education. Ad-hoc business analyses will occasionally be required, as will contributions to custom analytic software (e.g., model evaluation/selection/diagnostic techniques, design of experiment support, sampling designs, visualizations, and simulations).\n<br><br>\nExperience with R and/or Python (or a comparable statistical programming language such as SAS, SPSS, or MATLAB) and SQL, as well as familiarity with the principles of software engineering (e.g., object-oriented programming, test-driven development, usage of revision control software, etc.) is strongly desired for this position.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>marketing</li>\n</ul>\n\n#marketing\n<br><br>\nJob ID: 54190\n<br><br>\n<strong>#</strong>"}
