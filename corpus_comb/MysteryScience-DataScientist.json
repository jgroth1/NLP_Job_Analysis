Help us create more problem solvers by bringing a better science education to 25 million kids.\n<br><br>\n<strong>What is Mystery Science?</strong>\n<br><br>\nMystery Science has created the fastest growing science curriculum in the U.S. We\u2019re already used by teachers in more than 20% of elementary schools in the country. We have an early product with a lot of future plans, yet our sales have already taken off. In an industry that is plagued by long sales cycle and high barriers to entry, we\u2019ve sold thousands schools without a single sales person. We\u2019re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.\n<br><br>\n<strong>If you\u2019re looking for the basics:</strong>\n<li>$4M in funding from leading education investors</li>\n<li>Competitive salary</li>\n<li>Equity in a high-growth company</li>\n<li>401K, health care, vacation</li>\n<li>Customers who love us</li>\n\u2026but the real perks of working at Mystery Science are the quality of the people on your team and the problem we\u2019re solving.

Our mission is to help children stay curious as they grow up. Our first product is a tool for teachers to use in the classroom. It contains a full science curriculum that makes it easy for elementary teachers to re-create scientific discoveries in the class. Thanks to support from our teachers, we\u2019re now collecting kids\u2019 questions and building a platform to answer every question. We\u2019re preparing to build a visual Wikipedia for kids, enabling children to explore any question they have.\n<br><br>\nWe\u2019re on a mission to accelerate human progress by creating more problem solvers in the next generation. We\u2019re working on the most important infrastructure problem in the world today: our ability to solve problems. Richard Feynman explains the problem well. To paraphrase him: our modern lives are made possible by our knowledge of science and technology, yet remarkably few people have a scientific perspective on the world. At Mystery Science, we have developed a unique way to pass on knowledge to the next generation and develop children\u2019s ability to think.\n<br><br>\nIf you\u2019re an experienced Data Scientist with deep experience helping grow products and want to be an early member of our Growth Team, let\u2019s talk."}
