{"job title": "Data Science Internship", "company": "Project Concern International", "city state": "\u2013 San Diego, US-CA", "rating": "3.7", "job description": "This is an exciting opportunity to gain valuable work experience at an international development non-governmental organization (NGO) using your skills in data analysis and data science. PCI generates a lot of data through ongoing project monitoring, through one-off surveys during baseline/midterm/endline evaluations, or through research projects. While PCI has a robust monitoring, evaluation, learning and research (MERL) team, applying approaches and techniques from data science will be a new discipline for PCI. The primary goal of this internship will be to apply data analysis and data science methodologies across datasets to generate new analyses, predictive models and learnings for PCI. The analysis will answer questions such as: what factors are likely to predict positive or negative results within a given type of programming (such as female economic empowerment, or HIV/AIDs prevention); what demographic and socioeconomic variables are common for participants who complete and succeed in a program; and, what types of interventions are likely to lead to the most impact. The intern will work with the MERL and technical units to identify research questions and related datasets to mine, develop and test hypotheses, and document the methodologies used and results.\n<br><br>\nAdditional goals of the internship are to develop documentation and strategies around the future use of data science approaches across PCI and collaborate with the Director of Global Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on identifying opportunities for the future use of technology for data science, such as machine learning. The end result of the internship will be to deliver: 1) at least one research project; 2) documentation on what role data science, machine learning and AI can play at PCI, and what processes and infrastructure PCI needs to put in place; and 3) a presentation to the MERL team on research findings and recommendations for data science work. The intern will report to a Technical Advisor in PCI\u2019s MERL unit.\n<br><br>\n<strong>DUTIES &amp; KEY TASKS:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work with the technical and MERL teams to identify research topics and hypotheses to test using existing datasets</li>\n\n<li>Conduct a literature review on project documentation to familiarize yourself with PCI project and monitoring and evaluation methodologies and goals</li>\n\n<li>Develop an analysis plan to include key objectives, datasets used and proposed analytical methods for at least one research project</li>\n\n<li>Identify existing datasets and perform exchange-transform-load processes to match up the different datasets</li>\n\n<li>Mine data and test hypotheses using statistical analysis methodologies to generate insights, learnings, and predictive models that can be applied to existing and future PCI projects</li>\n\n<li>Create dashboards and other ways to visualize the results using data visualization software</li>\n\n<li>Document the process, tools and results of the analysis in a research report</li>\n\n<li>Meet with various PCI staff across technical teams to understand future data analysis and data science needs.
