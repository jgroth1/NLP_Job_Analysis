These include widely used drugs, formulated so they communicate when they have been ingested; a wearable patch that detects medicines and captures physiologic response; mobile applications to support patient self-care and physician decision-making; and data analytics to serve the needs of health system managers. The ingestible sensor and wearable patch at the heart of digital medicines were approved by the U.S. FDA in 2012, and also have regulatory clearances in the European Union and China. The company has more than 450 issued patents that protect this enabling technology.\n<br><br>\nProteus Digital Health is privately held by investors that include Carlyle, Essex Woodlands, Kaiser Permanente\u00ae, Medtronic\u00ae, Novartis\u00ae, Otsuka, and ON Semiconductor\u00ae.\n<br><br>\n<strong>The Products:</strong>\n<br><br>\nProteus Digital Health partners with health systems across the United States to provide Proteus Discover\u00ae, a digital medicines program that measures medication treatment effectiveness and helps physicians, care teams, and patients improve clinical outcomes. Proteus Discover provides the tools and data needed for health organizations to build patient engagement, efficiency, and measurement into the delivery of care, and an opportunity to mitigate the high costs of uncontrolled diseases.\n<br><br>\nIn November 2017, the FDA granted its first approval of a fully-integrated digital medicine, Abilify MyCite\u00ae. Abilify MyCite is a drug-device combination product of Otsuka Pharmaceutical\u2019s aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, embedded with Proteus\u2019 ingestible sensor that communicates with a wearable sensor patch, smartphone application, and the healthcare provider\u2019s portal.\n<br><br>\n<strong> Join Us:</strong>\n<br><br>\nCome to join our unique collection of innovative scientists, engineers, market makers, designers, doctors, pharmacists, developers, clinicians, and other digital health industry pioneers, and assist us to achieve our compelling vision, \u201cHealthcare for Everyone, Everywhere.\u201d\n<br><br>\nLearn more about what we do (video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0LR_g0Iw48 and follow us on Twitter @ProteusDH and LinkedIn.\n<br><br>\nFurther information is available at<strong> www.proteus.com.</strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Primary Responsibilities:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan and oversee development studies including use of design of experiments techniques</li><li>Build and test prototypes, both hands-on and via coordination with support functions and demonstrate full knowledge of the documentation that governs these operations.
