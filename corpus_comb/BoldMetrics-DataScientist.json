(BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.\n<br><br>\nHistorically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.\n<br><br>\nWe are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the worlds largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.<br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR<br><br>We are looking for an intellectually curious person, who has the drive to create sophisticated algorithms that can be translated efficiently to a scalable framework.
